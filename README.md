# To-Do-List

This project is a simple ToDoList application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, similar to my previous ToDoList (https://github.com/BelmaKorlat/ToDoList) created using HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, and Express. However, this version includes an additional feature, the 'Edit' button, which enables users to correct the tasks they have entered. Furthermore, it has been adapted for easy installation and usage, allowing users to install on an Android device and utilize the application effortlessly.
